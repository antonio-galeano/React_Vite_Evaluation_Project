# React_Vite_Evaluation_Project

This project is part of an educational series designed to enhance understanding of React's capabilities through three distinct exercises, each aimed at a specific aspect of React development. Each exercise is crafted within a React application created with Vite.

Demo: A live demo of this project is available in the Netlify Platform: https://reactvite-eval.netlify.app/
Feel free to explore the application and see it in action!

## Description

### Exercise 1: Text and Color State Management
Develop a React component that allows users to input text and change its color using three buttons. The component will utilize React state to handle text updates and color changes.

### Exercise 2: Dynamic List of CÉGEPs
This exercise involves displaying a list of CÉGEPs, where users can add a new CÉGEP with a name and logo URL through prompts and delete any CÉGEP from the list. It focuses on managing an array within React state and updating it dynamically.

### Exercise 3: Vehicle Reservation System
Create a series of components that make up a vehicle reservation system. This includes a navigation bar, a banner, and a list of electric vehicles that can be reserved. Implement logic to allow a user to make a single reservation, changing the state of the vehicle to reflect its reserved status.
